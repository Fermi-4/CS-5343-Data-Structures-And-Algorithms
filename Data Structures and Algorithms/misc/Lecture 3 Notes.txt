// search
main() {
	Node n = BST(root, val)

}



BST(tmp, val) {
	if(tmp == null) return null;
	if(tmp.val == val) return tmp;
	if(v > tmp.val) return BST(tmp.left, v);
	else return BST(tmp.right, v);
}

// insert
have it in the recording

// delete 
predecessor successor
successor smallest on the rigfht hand
pred largest value on the left

delete node and replace with pred, or successor

successor can at most have a right child - cannot have a right child

constant time

AVL Node {
	int val
	Node left;
	Node right;
	Node parent
	int height;
}


pred cannot have right child

take left child of pred and link with the right of the parent of the pred


successor - cannot have left child
parent of successor - take the right child of successor and link to the left of parent


exercise: 

pred = 30
second hw - write del impl for binary search tree
breadth first search
worst case for BST is O(n)

balanced BST: O(logN)

- 1st alg: delete, insert
- AVL tree: height tolerance of at most one-
- balancing done by rotating
check the parent - is there a problem? 1 2 3

left of middle node goes to the right if left node


zig zag - rotate 2-3, rotate normal
straight line - rotate once

Insert = O(logN)
Delete = O(logN)

height is always zero on insert because it is always a leaf node

next hw will be other balancing

look at nodes and then look at pointers
///////////////////////// sorting ///////////////////////////
selection sort - n^2
bubble sort - n^2


whats the big deal about bubble sort?
worst case bubble sort is n^2 best is n
selection sort is n^2 for best and worst
